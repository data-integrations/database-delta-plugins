Database Plugins for CDAP Delta Application

To run integration tests:

mvn clean verify

This will start a docker container running SQLServer and run integration
tests against it.

To debug integration tests:

mvn clean verify -Dmaven.failsafe.debug

this will cause maven to stop and wait for you to attach a remote debugger
to localhost on port 5005 before moving on and running the actual tests.
