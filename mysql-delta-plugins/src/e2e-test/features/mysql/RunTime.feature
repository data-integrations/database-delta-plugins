@Mysql @Required
Feature: Mysql - Verify Mysql source data transfer to BigQuery

  @MYSQL_SOURCE @MYSQL_DELETE @BQ_SINK_TEST
  Scenario: To verify replication of snapshot and cdc data from MySQL to BigQuery successfully
    Given Open DataFusion Project with replication to configure replication job
    When Enter input plugin property: "name" with pipelineName
    And Click on the "Next" button in replication to navigate
    And Select Source plugin: "MySQL" from the replication plugins list
    Then Replace input plugin property: "host" with value: "mysqlHost" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    Then Replace input plugin property: "port" with value: "mysqlPort" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    Then Select dropdown plugin property: "select-jdbcPluginName" with option value: "mysqlDriverName"
    Then Replace input plugin property: "database" with value: "mysqlDatabaseName"
    Then Replace input plugin property: "user" with value: "mysqlUsername" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    Then Replace input plugin property: "password" with value: "mysqlPassword" for Credentials and Authorization related fields
    And Click on the "Next" button in replication to navigate
    Then Replace input plugin property: "project" with value: "projectId"
    Then Enter input plugin property: "datasetName" with value: "dataset"
    And Click on the "Next" button in replication to navigate
    Then Select the source table if available
    And Click on the "Next" button in replication to navigate
    Then Wait till the Configure Advanced Properties page is loaded in replication
    And Click on the "Next" button in replication to navigate
    Then Wait till the Review Assessment page is loaded in replication
    And Click on the "Next" button in replication to navigate
    Then Deploy the replication pipeline
    And Run the replication Pipeline
    Then Open the Advanced logs
    And Wait till pipeline is in running state and check if no errors occurred
    Then Validate the values of records transferred to target Big Query table is equal to the values from source table
    And Run insert, update and delete CDC events on source table
    And Wait till CDC events are reflected in BQ
    Then Validate the values of records transferred to target Big Query table is equal to the values from source table
    And Open and capture logs
    Then Close the replication pipeline logs and stop the pipeline
